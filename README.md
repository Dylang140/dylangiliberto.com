This is my own peronal website that I created using JavaScript and React. It is nothing complicated or super exciting, but I wanted to have the URL for my name, and I wanted a simple site to link to my other accounts and to show a couple projects!

I will probably redo the site eventually, but for now, it has links to LinkedIn, Github, and my email, and has pages for two different projects I have done. I plan to add more projetcs that I've completed, and to add future projects I work on as well.
